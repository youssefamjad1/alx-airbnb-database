-- Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins

-- 1. INNER JOIN: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status,
    b.total_price,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email
FROM
    Booking b
INNER JOIN
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id;


-- 2. LEFT JOIN: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews
SELECT
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment,
    r.created_at AS review_date
FROM
    Property p
LEFT JOIN
    Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
ORDER BY
    p.property_id;


-- 3. FULL OUTER JOIN: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user
-- MySQL doesnâ€™t support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so we emulate it using LEFT + RIGHT JOIN and UNION
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    b.booking_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status
FROM
    User u
LEFT JOIN
    Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id

UNION

SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    b.booking_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status
FROM
    User u
RIGHT JOIN
    Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
